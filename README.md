# Post Labs Frontend Implementation

A modern web application built with cutting-edge technologies and smooth animations.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Next.js 15** - Latest React framework with App Router for optimal performance
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling
- **GSAP & ScrollTrigger** - Professional-grade animations and scroll-based interactions
- **Lenis** - Smooth scrolling library for enhanced user experience

### Technology Reasoning
- **Next.js 15**: Chose for its improved performance, React 19 compatibility, and excellent developer experience
- **TypeScript**: Essential for large-scale applications, provides compile-time error checking
- **Tailwind v4**: Latest version offers better performance and cleaner utility classes
- **GSAP**: Industry standard for complex animations with precise control
- **Lenis**: Provides buttery-smooth scrolling across all devices

## Key Features

### Animation Implementation
- **ScrollTrigger Integration**: Scroll-based animations for text reveals and card interactions
- **Custom Cursor Effects**: Interactive cursor with gradient effects in hero section
- **Staggered Text Animations**: Word-by-word text reveals with blur and opacity transitions
- **Card Animations**: Complex 3D transformations with rotation and scaling effects
- **Video Background**: Seamless looping video with overlay effects

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Complex Scroll Animations
**Problem**: Creating smooth, performant scroll-based animations
**Solution**: Implemented optimized GSAP timelines with efficient ScrollTrigger management

### Challenge 2: Video Background Performance
**Problem**: Large video files affecting page load times
**Solution**: Used optimized video formats (WebM/MP4) with poster images for faster loading

### Challenge 3: Custom Cursor Implementation
**Problem**: Creating cursor effects that don't interfere with native interactions
**Solution**: Used `pointer-events-none` and intersection observers for precise control

### Challenge 4: Typography Scaling
**Problem**: Maintaining readability across different viewport sizes
**Solution**: Implemented `clamp()` function for fluid typography scaling

## Component Architecture

### Core Components
- **HeroSection**: Landing area with custom cursor and animated typography
- **BuiltForScroller**: Video background with text cycling animation
- **CardSection**: Three-card layout with complex scroll interactions
- **TextReveal**: Reusable component for word-by-word text animations
- **SmoothScroller**: Global smooth scrolling wrapper using Lenis

### Animation Patterns
- **Desktop**: Full GSAP animations with scrub control and complex timelines
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Base functionality works without JavaScript
- **Performance Focus**: Optimized timeline management and memory cleanup

## Time Allocation Breakdown

### Development Phases (Estimated)
- **Setup & Configuration** (15%): Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind v4 setup
- **Component Development** (35%): Building core sections and layout
- **Animation Implementation** (30%): GSAP integration and scroll triggers
- **Optimization & Polish** (15%): Performance tuning and cross-browser testing
- **Documentation** (5%): Code documentation and README creation

### Key Priorities
1. **Functionality First**: Ensured all components work without animations
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Added animations as enhancement layer
3. **Performance Focus**: Optimized animation performance and memory management
4. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Verified compatibility across modern browsers

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Browser Support
- Chrome/Edge 88+
- Firefox 85+
- Safari 14+
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading for video content
- Optimized GSAP timeline management
- Efficient ScrollTrigger cleanup and memory management
- Strategic use of `will-change` CSS property for smooth animations
